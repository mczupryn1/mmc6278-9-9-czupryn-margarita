To receive full credit for this assignment, the finished application MUST:

Be useful (see Theme and Topic)
Be a Node and Express application.
Use Handlebars templates to render HTML.
Use MySQL or MongoDB as a database solution
Follow the MVC pattern.
Perform Create, Read, Update, and Delete data operations for a data resource. User data (username, password, etc.) DOES NOT count towards this requirement.
Incorporate at least one external API in a meaningful way.
Be responsive on mobile, tablet, and desktop devices.
Be deployed to Heroku and connected to JawsDB or MongoDB Atlas.
Regardless of database solution, the application must relate two different types of stored data in some fashion. Associating a data resource with user data WILL satisfy this requirement if you make an app with authentication regardless of whether you use a starter template.
